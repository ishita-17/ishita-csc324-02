# AI Investment of 62 Countries - An RShiny app

## Project Overview 

The *purpose* of this RShiny app was created to investigate the AI investment by 62 countries. As AI becomes more and more powerful and relevant in today's world, it is important to look at its growth in various countries. My *goal* is to create visualizations that would help us look at different factors of a country and their investment in AI to identify more powerful countries. \newline

There are 3 different graphs and 1 world map as visualizations. 
Graph 1: Bar Plot 
This visualization gives information about the countries' geographical regions and their income group, political power, and political regime. 
Graph 2: Bubble Plot 
This visualization gives us information about the countries' investment in R&D for AI, with the bubble size determined by various quantitative variables.  
Graph 3: Spider Plot 
This visualization gives us information about each country's numerical scores for the quantitative variables. 
World Map: 
The interactive world map allows us to see the *AI Global Rank* (total score) and income group for each country. 

As seen from all the visualizations, USA seemed to have gained the highest total score for AI investment.

Audience: The audience for this Shiny app can be any student or adult interested in learning about AI Investment by these 62 countries.
